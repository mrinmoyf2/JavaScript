  <h1>Basic JavaScript: Local Scope and Functions</h1>
  <p>Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.
  </p>



  <script type="text/javascript">
    function myLocalScope() {
      'use strict'; // you shouldn't need to edit this line
      var myVar = "yoo";
      console.log(myVar);
    }
    myLocalScope();
