    <h1>Practice comparing different values</h1>
<p>
  In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.
<br>
If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.
<br>
Examples
<br>
3 == '3' // returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number <br>
3 === '3' // returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed <br>
Note <br>
In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows: <br>

typeof 3 // returns 'number' <br>
typeof '3' // returns 'string'
</p>


    <script type="text/javascript">

      // Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (a === b) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
compareEquality(10, "10");

console.log(compareEquality());
    </script>
  </body>
