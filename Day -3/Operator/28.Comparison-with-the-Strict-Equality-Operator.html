    <h1>Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator</h1>
    <p>
      Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.
      <br>
      If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.
<br>
      Examples
<br>
      3 === 3 // true <br>
      3 === '3' // false <br>
      In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Setup
  function testStrict(val) {
    if (val === 7) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }

  // Change this value to test
  testStrict(10);
  console.log(testStrict());
